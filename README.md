This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This was my attempt at full stack development! The project is 90% complete with all that remains being the strip subscription model.
So if the profile page doesnt work like you would think this is why!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```


Note that this will not work since there are none of the DB keys in the .env file, to view the website please visit the link below

## Deploy on Vercel
